# Introduction

This is a very newly layed egg of an idea, and it needs time to incubate, as I've only thought about it for a little.
So far, I only decided what I'm going to use to develop it, and I'm not sure how its going to work out.
This is inspired by club penguin and how it gave children something to look forward to before and after school.
With that said, i plan on it to be easily accessible to anyone who wants to use it, whether its on their browser or mobile or a desktop app.

## This is the client for the game.

This means this repository is the part that is on a users' computer. Here is the [servers' repository](https://github.com/duckwithdafro/game_server)!

## The client tech stack

<!-- finish listing tech stack, then describe briefly what they are for -->
